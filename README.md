## UUCPM
This repo hosts the code for paper **"Zefeng Chen, Wensheng Gan, Gengsen Huang, Yanxin Zheng, and Philip S. Yu: Towards Utility-Driven Contiguous Sequential Patterns in Uncertain Multi-Sequences. Knowledge-Based Systems, 284(6) 111314 (2024)."**

## Requirements
Java programming language.

## Running the program
A simple way is to run MainTestUUCPM.java.

## Benchmarks
- The data format used is the same as in the file data.txt. That is, different positive integers represent different terms. In addition, "-1" is used as the itemset separator and "-2" is used as the sequence separator.
- Additional datasets used in the paper can be accessed from the branch of datasets.
